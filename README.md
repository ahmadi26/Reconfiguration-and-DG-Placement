Abstract: Today, with the development of distribution systems and increasing demand for electricity, the use of DG resources and network 
reconfiguration has increased in parallel in the power grid. From the planning, automation, management and operation point of view, the 
reconfiguration of the distribution network and the interconnection of renewable energy sources into the network play an important role 
in optimizing the power system, and coordination of these two approaches can have a significant effect on network efficiency improvement. 
Comparing the results of the fact that the use of DGs, along with the reconfiguration of the distribution network structure, can have far 
more impact compared to the asynchronous optimization. On the other hand, due to the variable and random nature of the primary energy of 
wind and solar power plants, the electric power delivered by these resources is random. In order to be more precise and to obtain realistic 
results, the uncertainties of the production potential of photovoltaic arrays and wind turbines should be considered. In this thesis, 
the integration of the Monte Carlo simulation method and the TLBO to solve the problem of the DG allocation along with the network 
reconfiguration, taking into account the uncertainty of the sources of wind and solar power generation, is used and implemented on 
the 33 and 69 IEEE bus test systems and the results of this method have been analyzed.
